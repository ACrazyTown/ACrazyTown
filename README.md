Hi! I do stuff on the internet sometimes. In this case, programming!

I really enjoy and primarily use the <a href="https://haxe.org">Haxe <img width="18" height="18" src="assets/haxe.png"></a> / <a href="https://lime.openfl.org/">lime <img width="24" height="24" src="https://lime.openfl.org/img/logonav.png"></a> / <a href="https://openfl.org/">OpenFL <img width="18" height="18" src="https://www.openfl.org/images/icon.png"></a> / <a href="https://haxeflixel.com">HaxeFlixel <img width="18" height="18" src="assets/haxeflixel.svg"></a> stack and often contribute to it.

Besides Haxe, I'm also familiar with Python, HTML/CSS/JS, C++ and PHP.
