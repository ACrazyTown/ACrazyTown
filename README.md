## ***About Me***
Hi! I'm **A Crazy Town**, or more informally, Anthony! I like doing a lot of random things whether that be art, animation, composing music or the thing that you're here for, code!

I code random things, but it's mostly just games I make when I'm bored. For that I use <a href="https://haxe.org">Haxe</a> <a href="https://haxe.org"><img width="16" height="16" src="assets/haxe.png"></a> with <a href="https://haxeflixel.com">HaxeFlixel</a> <a href="https://haxeflixel.com"><img width="16" height="16" src="assets/haxeflixel.svg"></a>

But aside from game development I also know how to use some other languages:
