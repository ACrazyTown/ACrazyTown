## ***About Me***
Hi! I'm **A Crazy Town**! I like doing a lot of random things whether that be art, animation, composing music or the thing that you're here for, code!

I basically code whatever comes to mind, whether that be silly little games or some other thingamajig. Currently I mostly use <a href="https://haxe.org">Haxe</a> <a href="https://haxe.org"><img width="16" height="16" src="assets/haxe.png"></a> (with the <a href="https://haxeflixel.com">HaxeFlixel framework</a> <a href="https://haxeflixel.com"><img width="16" height="16" src="assets/haxeflixel.svg"></a> if I make games).

I also know some other programming languages to a varying degree:

      - Uses the standard HTML/CSS/JS stack with a little PHP for some cool serverside stuff.
      - Does not use any frameworks, it's all written from scratch!

(I used to have more here but it's nothing worth showing off. The list will be expanded in the future!)
